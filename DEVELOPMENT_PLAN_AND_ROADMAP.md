# Inventory System — Full Lifecycle Development Plan & Roadmap
> Last audited: 2026-03-29 (post-refactor). All status markers reflect actual codebase state.

---

## Technical Mission
Build a production-ready ERP-grade inventory system where every unit of stock is traceable
from the moment it is ordered from a vendor to the moment it is sold to a customer — with
mathematically guaranteed accuracy via transactional integrity, real-time costing
(FIFO / LIFO / Weighted Average), and a complete audit trail at every step.

---

## System Lifecycle Overview

The full workflow of this system follows this chain:

```
[Setup] → [Vendor & Product Setup] → [Procurement / Inbound] → [Warehouse Operations]
       → [Sales / Outbound] → [Logistics] → [Financial Close] → [Reporting & Audit]
```

Each phase below corresponds to one stage of that chain.

---

## ✅ Phase 0 — Foundation: The Stock Engine
> Status: COMPLETE
> The mathematical core. Built and tested before any UI.

### 0.1 Stock Movement Engine (`StockService`)
- [x] `recordMovement(array $data): Transaction`
  - Creates a `Transaction` header + `TransactionLine` rows in a single DB transaction
  - Applies `lockForUpdate()` (pessimistic locking) on `Inventory` rows to prevent race conditions
  - **Draft/Posted enforcement** — inventory is ONLY updated when `status = posted`; drafts save header+lines only
  - Dispatches to `applyLineToInventory()` for each posted line
- [x] `postTransaction(Transaction $t): Transaction`
  - Promotes a draft → posted and applies all lines to inventory atomically
  - Guards against re-posting or posting a cancelled transaction
- [x] `recordTransfer(array $data): array`
  - Atomic double-sided movement: Issue from origin + Receipt at destination
  - Both legs in a single `DB::transaction()` — either both post or neither does
  - Creates a `Transfer` pivot record linking both transaction legs by FK (no more orphan transactions)
- [x] `consumeLayers(Inventory $inv, float $qty): float`
  - FIFO: consumes oldest layers first (`receipt_date ASC`)
  - LIFO: consumes newest layers first (`receipt_date DESC`)
  - Marks layer `is_exhausted = true` when `remaining_qty ≤ 0`
  - Throws `InsufficientStockException` if qty demanded exceeds available layers
  - **Returns the weighted-average unit cost of layers consumed** (COGS for the issue line)
- [x] `updateLocationAverageCost(Inventory $inv, float $newQty, float $newCost)`
  - Per-location WAC: `(Existing_Value + New_Value) / (Existing_Qty + New_Qty)`
  - Updates `inventories.average_cost` only (in-memory before save)
- [x] `updateProductGlobalAverageCost(int $productId)`
  - **Correct global WAC formula**: `SUM(location_QOH × location_avg_cost) / SUM(location_QOH)` across ALL locations
  - Called AFTER `$inventory->save()` so the query sees the latest state
  - Eliminates the single-location contamination bug
- [x] `applyLineToInventory(TransactionLine, array)` — extracted private method reused by both `recordMovement` and `postTransaction`
- [x] `TransactionValidator` — pre-movement guard (type, location, quantity sanity checks)
- [x] `InsufficientStockException` — typed exception for over-issue scenarios

### 0.2 Database Schema
- [x] 35 migrations covering every business domain
- [x] 40 Eloquent models with full relationships, soft deletes, and fillables
- [x] `inventories` — per-product per-location QOH cache + average cost
- [x] `inventory_cost_layers` — FIFO/LIFO layers with `received_qty`, `issued_qty`, computed `remaining_qty`, `is_exhausted`
- [x] `transactions` + `transaction_lines` — the immutable ledger (issue lines now record actual COGS in `unit_cost`)
- [x] `transaction_types` + `transaction_statuses` — lookup tables (Receipt, Issue, Transfer, Adjustment)
- [x] `transfers` — pivot table linking the two transaction legs of every stock transfer by FK

### 0.3 Automated Tests
- [x] FIFO layer test: 3 receipts at different unit costs → verify correct layer consumed on issue
- [x] LIFO layer test: same as above but in reverse order
- [x] Concurrency test: 10 simultaneous issues of last 1 unit → only 1 succeeds, 9 throw exception
- [x] UOM Conversion test: receive 1 Box → verify `quantity_on_hand` increases by 12 (pieces)
- [x] Average cost test: verify WAC formula recalculates correctly across multiple receipts

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Dashboard: `transactions_today` stat** — Add live today-count to `DashboardController` and Dashboard KPI cards. ✅ Done
2. **Fix hardcoded transaction type/status IDs** — Resolve `transaction_type_id` and `transaction_status_id` by slug name in all movement forms, not integer IDs.
3. **Purchase Orders lifecycle (Phase 4)** — `PurchaseOrderController` + GRN flow + frontend list/create/receive pages. Schema and models already exist.
4. **User Management (Phase 9.1)** — `UserController` + User Management page for production multi-user use.
5. **Category Management page (Phase 9.4)** — Low friction; `CategoryController` already exists in the API.
6. **Dashboard mini-chart** — Stock value trend visualization (last 7 days) on the Dashboard.
